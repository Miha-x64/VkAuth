# VkAuth

Authentication library for VK and Android.

* Much more lightweight than
[Official SDK](https://github.com/VKCOM/vk-android-sdk);
* much better designed (no static Context, no `registerObject()` and such things);
* we'd accept issues and PRs (official SDK are not).

# Features

* authentication via official app and WebView (if no app)
* delivering results to Activity or Fragment

# Planned

* CAPTCHA and verification support
* v4 Fragment support
* a way to trigger auth through app or a WebView forcibly
